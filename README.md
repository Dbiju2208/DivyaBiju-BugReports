# DivyaBiju-BugReports

## Introduction
Welcome to our software repository. This respository is like our go-to spot for managing feature requests and bug reports for our Application. Our main goal is to keep improving the software based on the awesome feedback we get from our users.

## Purpose

This repository is all about making it easier for users, like we, to connect and work together with our development team. It's like a central hub where we can report any bugs or issues you come across while using the software. And the best part is, we can also suggest new features to make the software even better! So, it's like a place where users and the development team can collaborate and improve the software together. 

If we've come across a pesky bug that needs fixing or have a brilliant idea for a new feature that would totally change the game with our software, this repository is the spot to share your thoughts and be a part of its continuous development.
